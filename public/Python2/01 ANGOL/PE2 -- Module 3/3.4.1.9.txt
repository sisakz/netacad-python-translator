<h1>Reflection and introspection</h1>

<p>All these means allow the Python programmer to perform two important activities specific to many objective languages. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>introspection</strong>, which is the ability of a program to examine the type or properties of an object at runtime;</li>
<li><strong>reflection</strong>, which goes a step further, and is the ability of a program to manipulate the values, properties and/or functions of an object at runtime.</li>
</ul>
 

<p>In other words, you don't have to know a complete class/object definition to manipulate the object, as the object and/or its class contain the metadata allowing you to recognize its features during program execution. </p>
