<h1>What does an object have?</h1>


<p>The object programming convention assumes that <strong>every existing object may be equipped with three groups of attributes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>an object has a <strong>name</strong> that uniquely identifies it within its home namespace (although there may be some anonymous objects, too)</li>
<li>an object has a <strong>set of individual properties</strong> which make it original, unique, or outstanding (although it's possible that some objects may have no properties at all)</li>
<li>an object has a <strong>set of abilities to perform specific activities</strong>, able to change the object itself, or some of the other objects.</li>
</ul>
 

<p>There is a hint (although this doesn't always work) which can help you identify any of the three spheres above. Whenever you describe an object and you use:</p>

<ul>
<li>a noun – you probably define the object's name;</li>
<li>an adjective – you probably define the object's property;</li>
<li>a verb – you probably define the object's activity.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Two sample phrases should serve as a good example:</p>

<ul>
 

<li><font size="+1">A pink Cadillac went quickly.</font>
<br><br>

Object name = Cadillac
<br>

Home class = Wheeled vehicles
<br>

Property = Color (pink)
<br>

Activity = Go (quickly)
</li>
</ul>



<br>
<br> 




</div>






<div class="small-12 large-6 columns">


<br>

<ul>
<li><font size="+1">Max is a large cat who sleeps all day.</font>
<br><br>

Object name = Max
<br>

Home class = Cat
<br>

Property = Size (large)
<br>

Activity = Sleep (all day)
<br><br></li>

</ul>
