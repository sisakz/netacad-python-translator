<h1>Class hierarchies</h1>

<p>The word <i>class</i> has many meanings, but not all of them are compatible with the ideas we want to discuss here. The <i>class</i> that we are concerned with is like a <i>category</i>, as a result of precisely defined similarities.</p>

<p>We'll try to point out a few classes which are good examples of this concept.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Let's look for a moment at vehicles. All existing vehicles (and those that don't exist yet) are <strong>related by a single, important feature</strong>: the ability to move. You may argue that a dog moves, too; is a dog a vehicle? No, it isn't. We have to improve the definition, enrich it with other criteria, in order to distinguish vehicles from other beings, and create a stronger connection. Let's take the following circumstances into consideration: vehicles are artificially created entities used for transportation, moved by forces of nature, and directed (driven) by humans.</p>

<p>Based on this definition, a dog is not a vehicle.</p>

<p>The <i>vehicles</i> class is very broad. Too broad. We have to define some more <strong>specialized classes</strong>, then. The specialized classes are the <strong>subclasses</strong>. The <i>vehicles</i> class will be a <strong>superclass</strong> for them all.</p>

<br>

<p>Note: <strong>the hierarchy grows from top to bottom, like tree roots, not branches</strong>. The most general, and the widest, class is always at the top (the superclass) while its descendants are located below (the subclasses).</p>

<p>By now, you can probably point out some potential subclasses for the <i>Vehicles</i> superclass. There are many possible classifications. We've chosen subclasses based on the environment, and say that there are (at least) four subclasses:</p>

<ul>
<li>land vehicles;</li>
<li>water vehicles;</li>
<li>air vehicles;</li>
<li>space vehicles.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this example, we'll discuss the first subclass only – land vehicles. If you wish, you can continue with the remaining classes.</p>

<p>Land vehicles may be further divided, depending on the method with which they impact the ground. So, we can enumerate:</p>

<ul>
<li>wheeled vehicles;</li>
<li>tracked vehicles;</li>
<li>hovercrafts.</li>
</ul>

<p>The hierarchy we've created is illustrated by the figure.</p>

<p>Note the direction of the arrows – they always point to the superclass. The top-level class is an exception – it doesn't have its own superclass.</p>
