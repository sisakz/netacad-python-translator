<h2>Opening the streams: modes</h2>

<p><codel>r</codel> open mode: read</p>

<ul>
<li>the stream will be opened in <strong>read mode</strong>;</li>
<li>the file associated with the stream <strong>must exist</strong> and has to be readable, otherwise the <codel>open()</codel> function raises an exception.</li>
</ul>


<p><codel>w</codel> open mode: write</p>

<ul>
<li>the stream will be opened in <strong>write mode</strong>;</li>
<li>the file associated with the stream <strong>doesn't need to exist</strong>; if it doesn't exist it will be created; if it exists, it will be truncated to the length of zero (erased); if the creation isn't possible (e.g., due to system permissions) the <codel>open()</codel> function raises an exception.</li>
</ul>


<p><codel>a</codel> open mode: append</p>

<ul>
<li>the stream will be opened in <strong>append mode</strong>;</li>
<li>the file associated with the stream <strong>doesn't need to exist</strong>; if it doesn't exist, it will be created; if it exists the virtual recording head will be set at the end of the file (the previous content of the file remains untouched.)</li>
</ul>

<p><codel>r+</codel> open mode: read and update</p>

<ul>
<li>the stream will be opened in <strong>read and update mode</strong>;</li>
<li>the file associated with the stream <strong>must exist and has to be writeable</strong>, otherwise the <codel>open()</codel> function raises an exception;</li>
<li>both read and write operations are allowed for the stream.</li>
</ul>

<p><codel>w+</codel> open mode: write and update</p>

<ul>
<li>the stream will be opened in <strong>write and update</strong> mode;</li>
<li>the file associated with the stream <strong>doesn't need to exist</strong>; if it doesn't exist, it will be created; the previous content of the file remains untouched;</li>
<li>both read and write operations are allowed for the stream.</li>

<h2>Selecting text and binary modes</h2>



<p>If there is a letter <codel>b</codel> at the end of the mode string, it means that the stream is to be opened in <strong>binary mode</strong>.</p>

<p>If the mode string ends with a letter <codel>t</codel>, the stream is opened in <strong>text mode</strong>.</p>

<p>Text mode is the default behaviour assumed when no binary/text mode specifier is used.</p>

<p>Finally, the successful opening of a file will set the current file position (the virtual reading/writing head) before the first byte of the file <strong>if the mode <b>is not</b> <codel>a</codel></strong> and after the last byte of the file <strong>if the mode <b>is</b> set to <codel>a</codel></strong>.</p>

<p>You can also open a file for its exclusive creation. You can do this using the <codel>x</codel> open mode. If the file already exists, the <codel>open()</codel> function will raise an exception.</p>
