<h2>File streams</h2>

<p>The opening of the stream is not only associated with the file, but should also declare the manner in which the stream will be processed. This declaration is called an <strong>open mode</strong>.</p>

<p>If the opening is successful, the <strong>program will be allowed to perform only the operations which are consistent with the declared open mode</strong>.</p>


<p>There are two basic operations performed on the stream:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>read</strong> from the stream: the portions of the data are retrieved from the file and placed in a memory area managed by the program (e.g., a variable);</li>
<li><strong>write</strong> to the stream: the portions of the data from the memory (e.g., a variable) are transferred to the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are three basic modes used to open the stream:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>read mode</strong>: a stream opened in this mode allows <strong>read operations only</strong>; trying to write to the stream will cause an exception (the exception is named <font face="Courier New">UnsupportedOperation</font>, which inherits <font face="Courier New">OSError</font> and <font face="Courier New">ValueError</font>, and comes from the <font face="Courier New">io</font> module);</li>

<li><strong>write mode</strong>: a stream opened in this mode allows <strong>write operations only</strong>; attempting to read the stream will cause the exception mentioned above;</li>

<li><strong>update mode</strong>: a stream opened in this mode allows <strong>both writes and reads</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we discuss how to manipulate the streams, we owe you some explanation. <strong>The stream behaves almost like a tape recorder</strong>.</p>

<p>When you read something from a stream, a virtual head moves over the stream according to the number of bytes transferred from the stream.</p>

<p>When you write something to the stream, the same head moves along the stream recording the data from the memory.</p>

<p>Whenever we talk about reading from and writing to the stream, try to imagine this analogy. The programming books refer to this mechanism as the <strong>current file position</strong>, and we'll also use this term.</p>

<p>It's necessary now to show you the object responsible for representing streams in programs.</p>
