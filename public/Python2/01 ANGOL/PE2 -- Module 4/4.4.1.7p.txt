<h1>The system() function</h1>


<p>All functions presented in this part of the course can be replaced by a function called <i>system</i>, which executes a command passed to it as a string.</p>

<p>The <codel>system</codel> function is available in both Windows and Unix. Depending on the system, it returns a different result.</p>

<p>In Windows, it returns the value returned by the shell after running the command given, while in Unix, it returns the exit status of the process.</p>

<p>Let's look at the code in the editor and see how it is in practice.</p>

<p>Result:</p>
<codep>0</codep>
<p style="text-align: right;"><font size="-2"><b>output</b></font></p>


<p>The above example will work in both Windows and Unix. In our case, we receive exit status 0, which indicates success on Unix systems.</p>

<p>This means that the <i>my_first_directory</i> directory has been created. As part of the exercise, try to list the contents of the directory where you created the <i>my_first_directory</i> directory.</p>
