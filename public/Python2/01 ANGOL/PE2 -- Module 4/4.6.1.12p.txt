<h1>The <font face="Courier New">monthdays2calendar()</font> method</h1>

<p>The <codel>Calendar</codel> class has several other useful methods that you can learn more about in the documentation (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html" target="_blank">https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html</a>).</p>

<p>One of them is the <codel>monthdays2calendar</codel> method, which takes the year and month, and then returns a list of weeks in a specific month. Each week is a tuple consisting of day numbers and weekday numbers. Look at the code in the editor.</p>

<p>Note that the day numbers outside the month are represented by 0, while the weekday numbers are a number from 0-6, where 0 is Monday and 6 is Sunday.</p>

<p>In a moment, this method may be useful for you to complete a laboratory task. Are you ready?</p>
