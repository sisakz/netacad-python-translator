<h1>Processing text files: <font face="Courier New">readline()</font></h1>


<p>If you want to treat the file's contents <strong>as a set of lines</strong>, not a bunch of characters, the <codel>readline()</codel> method will help you with that.</p>

<p>The method tries to <strong>read a complete line of text from the file</strong>, and returns it as a string in the case of success. Otherwise, it returns an empty string.</p>

<p>This opens up new opportunities â€“ now you can also count lines easily, not only characters.</p>

<p>Let's make use of it. Look at the code in the editor.</p>

<p>As you can see, the general idea is exactly the same as in both previous examples.</p>
