<h1>Creating a date object from a timestamp</h1>


<p>The <codel>date</codel> class gives us the ability to create a <i>date</i> object from a <i>timestamp</i>.</p>

<p>In Unix, the timestamp expresses the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC). This date is called the <b>Unix epoch</b>, because this is when the counting of time began on Unix systems.</p>

<p>The timestamp is actually the difference between a particular date (including time) and January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC), expressed in seconds.</p>

<p>To create a date object from a timestamp, we must pass a Unix timestamp to the <codel>fromtimestamp</codel> method.</p>

<p>For this purpose, we can use the <codel>time</codel> module, which provides time-related functions. One of them is a function called <codel>time()</codel>, which returns the number of seconds from January 1, 1970 to the current moment in the form of a float number. Take a look at the example in the editor.</p>

<p>Run the code to see the output.</p>

<p>If you run the sample code several times, you'll be able to see how the timestamp increments itself. It's worth adding that the result of the <codel>time</codel> function depends on the platform, because <b>in Unix and Windows systems, leap seconds aren't counted</b>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> In this part of the course we'll also talk about the <i>time</i> module.</p>
