<h1>Introduction to the <i>datetime</i> module</h1>


<p>In this section, you'll learn about a Python module called <i>datetime</i>.</p>

<p>As you can guess, it provides <b>classes for working with date and time</b>. If you think you don't need to delve into this topic, let's talk about examples of using date and time in programming.</p>

<p>Date and time have countless uses and it's probably hard to find a production application that doesn't use them. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>event logging</b> — thanks to the knowledge of date and time, we are able to determine when exactly a critical error occurs in our application. When creating logs, you can specify the date and time format;</li>
<li><b>tracking changes in the database</b> — sometimes it's necessary to store information about when a record was created or modified. The <i>datetime</i> module will be perfect for this case;</li>
<li><b>data validation</b> — you'll soon learn how to read the current date and time in Python. Knowing the current date and time, you'll be able to validate various types of data, e.g., whether a discount coupon entered by a user in our application is still valid;</li>
<li><b>storing important information</b> — can you imagine bank transfers without storing the information of when they were made? The date and time of certain actions must be preserved, and we must deal with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Date and time are used in almost every area of our lives, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the Python <i>datetime</i> module. Are you ready for a new dose of knowledge?<p>
