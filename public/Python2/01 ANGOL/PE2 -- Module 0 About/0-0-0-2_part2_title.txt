<h1>Course Syllabus</h1>

<p>In this course you will learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>how to adopt general coding techniques and best practices in your projects;</li>
<li>how to process strings;</li>
<li>how to use object-oriented programming in Python;</li>
<li>how to import and use Python modules, including the <i>math</i>, <i>random</i>, <i>platform</i>, <i>os</i>, <i>time</i>, <i>datetime</i>, and <i>calendar</i> modules;</li>
<li>how to create and use your own Python modules and packages;</li>
<li>how to use the exception mechanism in Python;</li>
<li>how to use generators, iterators, and closures in Python;</li>
<li>how to process files.</li>
</ul>


<br>

<p>The course is divided into four modules:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Module 1</strong>
<br>Modules, Packages and PIP</li>


<li><strong>Module 2</strong>
<br>Strings, string and list methods, and exceptions</li>


<li><strong>Module 3</strong>
<br>Object-Oriented Programming</li>

<li><strong>Module 4</strong>
<br>Miscellaneous (generators, iterators, closures, file streams, processing text and binary files, the <i>os</i>, <i>time</i>, <i>datetime</i>, and <i>calendar</i> modules)</li>

</ol>

<h1>Why should you learn PYTHON?</h1>

<p>Python is omnipresent. People use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not. There have been millions (well, actually billions) of lines of code written in Python, which means almost unlimited opportunities for code reuse and learning from well-crafted examples. What's more, there is a large and very active Python community, always happy to help.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of factors that make Python great for learning:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is easy to learn – the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; this means that it's possible to start the actual programming faster;</li>
<li>It is easy to use for writing new software – it's often possible to write code faster when using Python;</li>
<li>It is easy to obtain, install and deploy – Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Completing this course can act as a stepping-stone to learning any other programming language, and to exploring technologies using Python as a foundation (e.g., Django). The course is distinguished by its affordability, friendliness, and openness to the student.</p>

<p>The first part of the course series started from the absolute basics, guiding you step by step to more complex problems that will be explained in this part, making you a responsible software creator able to tackle different challenges in many positions in the IT industry.</p>
