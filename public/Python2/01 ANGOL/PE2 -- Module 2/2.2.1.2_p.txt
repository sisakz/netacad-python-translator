<h1>Multiline strings</h1>

<p>Now is a very good moment to show you another way of specifying strings inside the Python source code. Note that the syntax you already know won't let you use a string occupying more than one line of text.</p>

<p>For this reason, the code here is erroneous:</p>

<codep><font style="color:red;">multiline = 'Line #1
Line #2'

print(len(multiline))</font>

</codep>
<br>
 

<p>Fortunately, for these kinds of strings, Python offers separate, convenient, and simple syntax.</p>

<br>


<p>Look at the code in the editor. This is what it looks like.</p>

 
<p>As you can see, the string starts with <strong>three apostrophes</strong>, not one. The same tripled apostrophe is used to terminate it.</p>

<p>The number of text lines put inside such a string is arbitrary.</p>

<p>The snippet outputs <codel>15</codel>.</p>

<p>Count the characters carefully. Is this result correct or not? It looks okay at first glance, but when you count the characters, it doesn't.</p>

<p><codel>Line #1</codel> contains seven characters. Two such lines comprise 14 characters. Did we lose a character? Where? How?</p>

<p>No, we didn't.</p>

<p><strong>The missing character is simply invisible â€“ it's a whitespace</strong>. It's located between the two text lines.</p>

<p>It's denoted as: <codel>\n</codel>.</p>

 
<p>Do you remember? It's a special (control) character used to <strong>force a line feed</strong> (hence its name: LF). You can't see it, but it counts.</p>

<p>Multiline strings can be delimited by <strong>triple quotes</strong>, too, just like here:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">multiline = """Line #1
Line #2"""

print(len(multiline))
</codep>

 
<br>

<p>Choose the method that is more comfortable for you. Both work the same.</p>
