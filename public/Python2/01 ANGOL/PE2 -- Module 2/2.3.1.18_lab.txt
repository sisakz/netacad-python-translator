<br><br>

<h2>Estimated time</h2>
<p>20-25 minutes</p>

<h2>Level of difficulty</h2>
<p>Medium</p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>improving the student's skills in operating with strings;</li>
<li>using built-in Python string methods.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>You already know how <codel>split()</codel> works. Now we want you to prove it.</p>

<p>Your task is to <strong>write your own function, which behaves almost exactly like the original <codel>split()</codel> method</strong>, i.e.:</p>

<ul>
<li>it should accept exactly one argument – a string;</li>
<li>it should return a list of words created from the string, divided in the places where the string contains whitespaces;</li>
<li>if the string is empty, the function should return an empty list;</li>
<li>its name should be <codel>mysplit()</codel></li>
</ul>


<p>Use the template in the editor. Test your code carefully.</p>


<h2>Expected output</h2>
<codep>['To', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be,', 'that', 'is', 'the', 'question']
['To', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be,that', 'is', 'the', 'question']
[]
['abc']
[]</codep>
