<h1>Exceptions</h1>

<p>Each time your code tries to do something wrong/foolish/irresponsible/crazy/unenforceable, Python does two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>it <strong>stops your program</strong>;</li>
<li>it creates a special kind of data, called an <strong>exception</strong>.</li>
</ul>
 

<p>Both of these activities are called <strong>raising an exception</strong>. We can say that Python always raises an exception (or that an <strong>exception has been raised</strong>) when it has no idea what to do with your code.</p>

<p>What happens next?</p>

<ul>
<li>the raised exception expects somebody or something to notice it and take care of it;</li>
<li>if nothing happens to take care of the raised exception, the program will be <strong>forcibly terminated</strong>, and you will see an <strong>error message</strong> sent to the console by Python;</li>
<li>otherwise, if the exception is taken care of and <strong>handled</strong> properly, the suspended program can be resumed and its execution can continue.</li>
</ul>
 

<p>Python provides effective tools that allow you to <strong>observe exceptions, identify them and handle them</strong> efficiently. This is possible due to the fact that all potential exceptions have their unambiguous names, so you can categorize them and react appropriately.</p>

<p>You know some exception names already. Take a look at the following diagnostic message:</p>

<codep><mark style="background-color:#e6f2ff;">ValueError</mark>: math domain error </codep>
<p style="text-align: right;"><font size="-2"><b>output</b></font></p>


<p>The word highlighted above is just the <strong>exception name</strong>. Let's get familiar with some other exceptions.</p>
