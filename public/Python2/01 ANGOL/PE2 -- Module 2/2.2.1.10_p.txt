<h1>Operations on strings: continued</h1>

<p>Don't think that a string's immutability limits your ability to operate with strings.</p>

<p>The only consequence is that you have to remember about it, and implement your code in a slightly different way â€“ look at the example code in the editor.</p>

 
<p>This form of code is fully acceptable, will work without bending Python's rules, and will bring the full Latin alphabet to your screen:</p>

<codep>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</codep>
<p style="text-align: right;"><font size="-2"><b>output</b></font></p>


<p>You may want to ask if <strong>creating a new copy of a string each time you modify its contents worsens the effectiveness of the code</strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, it does. A bit. It's not a problem at all, though.</p>
