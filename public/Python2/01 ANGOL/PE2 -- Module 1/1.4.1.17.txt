<h1>Use <i>pip</i>!</h1>

<p><i>Pip</i>'s capabilities don't end here, but the command set we've presented to you is enough to start successfully managing packages that aren't a part of the regular Python installation.</p>

<p>We hope we’ve encouraged you to carry out your own experiments with <i>pip</i> and the Python package universe. PyPI invites you to dive into its extensive resources.</p>

<p>Some say that one of the most important programming virtues is <b>laziness</b>. Don't get us wrong – we don't want you to spend all day napping on the couch and dreaming of Python code.</p>

<p>A lazy programmer is a programmer who looks for existing solutions and analyzes the available code before they start to develop their own software from scratch. </p>

<p>This is why PyPI and <i>pip</i> exist – use them!</p>
