<h1>Is there real randomness in computers?</h1>

<p>Another module worth mentioning is the one named <codel>random</codel>.</p>

<p>It delivers some mechanisms allowing you to operate with <strong>pseudorandom numbers</strong>.</p>

Note the prefix <strong>pseudo</strong> – the numbers generated by the modules may look random in the sense that you cannot predict their subsequent values, but don't forget that they all are calculated using very refined algorithms. </p>

<br>

The algorithms aren't random – they are deterministic and predictable. Only those physical processes which run completely out of our control (like the intensity of cosmic radiation) may be used as a source of actual random data. Data produced by deterministic computers cannot be random in any way.

<br>

<p>A random number generator takes a value called a <strong>seed</strong>, treats it as an input value, calculates a "random" number based on it (the method depends on a chosen algorithm) and produces a <strong>new seed value</strong>.</p>


<p>The length of a cycle in which all seed values are unique may be very long, but it isn't infinite – sooner or later the seed values will start repeating, and the generating values will repeat, too. This is normal. It's a feature, not a mistake, or a bug.</p>

 
<p>The initial seed value, set during the program start, determines the order in which the generated values will appear.</p>

<p>The random factor of the process may be <strong>augmented by setting the seed with a number taken from the current time</strong> – this may ensure that each program launch will start from a different seed value (ergo, it will use different random numbers).</p>

<p>Fortunately, such an initialization is done by Python during module import.</p>
