<h1>Importing a module</h1>

<p>To make a module usable, you must <strong>import</strong> it (think of it like of taking a book off the shelf). Importing a module is done through an instruction named <codel>import</codel>. Note: <codel>import</codel> is also a keyword (with all the consequences of this fact).</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Let's assume that you want to use two entities provided by the <codel>math</codel> module:</p>

<ul>
<li>a symbol (constant) representing a precise (as precise as possible using double floating-point arithmetic) value of &pi; (although using a Greek letter to name a variable is fully possible in Python, the symbol is named <strong>pi</strong> â€“ it's a more convenient solution, especially for that part of the world which neither has nor is going to use a Greek keyboard)</li>

<li>a function named <codel>sin()</codel>, the computer equivalent of the mathematical <i>sine</i> function.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Both these entities are available through the <codel>math</codel> module, but the way in which you can use them strongly depends on how the import has been done.</p>

<br>

<div class="small-12 large-6 columns">

<br>

<p>The simplest way to import a particular module is to use the import instruction as follows:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">import math
</codep>
<br>

<p>The clause contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <codel>import</codel> keyword;</li>
<li>the <strong>name of the module</strong> which is subject to import.</li>
</ul>

<p>The instruction may be located anywhere in your code, but it must be placed <strong>before the first use of any of the module's entities</strong>.</p>

<br>

<p>If you want to (or have to) import more than one module, you can do it by repeating the <codel>import</codel> clause (preferred):</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">import math
import sys
</codep>

<br>

<p>or by listing the modules after the <codel>import</codel> keyword, like here:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">import math, sys
</codep>
<br>

 
<p>The instruction imports two modules, first the one named <codel>math</codel> and then the second named <codel>sys</codel>.</p>

<p>The list of modules to import may be arbitrarily long.</p>
