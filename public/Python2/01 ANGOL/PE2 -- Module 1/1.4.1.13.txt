<h1>How to use <i>pip</i>: continued</h1>


<p>Assuming that your search is successful (or you’re determined to install a specific package of an already known name) you can use pip to install the package onto your computer.</p>

<p>Two possible scenarios may be put into action now:</p>

<ul>
<li>you want to install a new package for you only – it won't be available for any other user (account) existing on your computer; this procedure is the only one available if you can’t elevate your permissions and act as a system administrator;</li>

<li>you’ve decided to install a new package system-wide – you have administrative rights and you're not afraid to use them.</li>
</ul>


<p>To distinguish between these two actions, pip uses a dedicated option named <codel>--user</codel> (note the double dash). The presence of this option instructs pip to act locally on behalf of your (non-administrative) user.</p>

<p>If you don’t add this, pip assumes that you’re a system administrator and it’ll do nothing to correct you if you’re not.</p>

<p>In our case, we’re going to install a package named pygame – it's an extended and complex library allowing programmers to develop computer games using Python.</p>

<p>The project has been in development since the year 2000, so it's a mature and reliable piece of code. If you want to know more about the project and about the community which leads it, visit <a href="https://www.pygame.org" target="_blank">https://www.pygame.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re a system administrator, you can install pygame using the following command:</p>

<p><codep class="syntax-color">pip install pygame
</codep></p>

<br>

<p>If you're not an admin, or you don't want to fatten up your OS by installing pygame system-wide, you can install it for you only:</p>

<p><codep class="syntax-color">pip install --user pygame
</codep></p>

<p>It's up to you which of the above procedures you want to take place.</p>

<br>

<p>Pip has a habit of displaying fancy textual animation indicating the installation progress, so watch the screen carefully – don't miss the show! If the process is successful, you’ll see something like this:</p>



<p>We encourage you to use:</p>

<p><codep class="syntax-color">pip show pygame
</codep></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><codep class="syntax-color">pip list
</codep></p>

<p>to get more information about what actually happened.</p>
