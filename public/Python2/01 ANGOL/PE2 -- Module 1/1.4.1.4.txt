<h1>The PyPI repo: the Cheese Shop (continued)</h1>

<p>PyPI is a very specific shop, not just because it offers all its products for free. It also requires a special tool to make use of it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this tool is also free, so if you want to make your own digital cheeseburger by using the goods offered by the PyPI Shop, you’ll need a free tool named <i>pip</i>. </p>

<p>No, you haven't misheard. Just <i>pip</i>. It's another acronym, of course, but its nature is more complex than the previously mentioned PyPI, as it's an example of a recursive acronym, which means that the acronym refers to itself, which means that explaining it is an infinite process. </p>
