<h1>Lists in action</h1>

<p>Let's leave lists aside for a short moment and look at one intriguing issue.</p>

<p>Imagine that you need to rearrange the elements of a list, i.e., reverse the order of the elements: the first and the fifth as well as the second and fourth elements will be swapped. The third one will remain untouched.</p>

<br>

<p>Question: how can you swap the values of two variables?</p>

<p>Take a look at the snippet:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">variable_1 = 1
variable_2 = 2

variable_2 = variable_1
variable_1 = variable_2
</codep>

<br>

<p>If you do something like this, you would <strong>lose the value previously stored</strong> in <codel>variable_2</codel>. Changing the order of the assignments will not help. You need a <strong>third variable that serves as an auxiliary storage</strong>.</p>

<p>This is how you can do it:</p>

<codep>variable_1 = 1
variable_2 = 2

<mark style="background-color:#e6f2ff;">auxiliary</mark> = variable_1
variable_1 = variable_2
variable_2 = <mark style="background-color:#e6f2ff;">auxiliary</mark>

</codep>

<br>

<p>Python offers a more convenient way of doing the swap ‒ take a look:</p>

<codep>variable_1 = 1
variable_2 = 2

variable_1, variable_2 = variable_2, variable_1

</codep>

<br>

<p>Clear, effective and elegant ‒ isn't it?</p>
