<h1>Indexing lists</h1>

<p>How do you change the value of a chosen element in the list?</p>

<p>Let's <strong>assign a new value of <codel>111</codel> to the first element</strong> in the list. We do it this way:</p>

<codep>numbers = [10, 5, 7, 2, 1]
print("Original list contents:", numbers)  # Printing original list contents.

<mark style="background-color:#e6f2ff;">numbers[0] = 111</mark>
print("New list contents: ", numbers)  # Current list contents.

</codep>

<br>

<hr>

<p>And now we want <strong>the value of the fifth element to be copied to the second element</strong> ‒ can you guess how to do it?</p>

<codep>numbers = [10, 5, 7, 2, 1]
print("Original list contents:", numbers)  # Printing original list contents.

numbers[0] = 111
print("\nPrevious list contents:", numbers)  # Printing previous list contents.

<mark style="background-color:#e6f2ff;">numbers[1] = numbers[4]</mark>  # Copying value of the fifth element to the second.
print("New list contents:", numbers)  # Printing current list contents.

</codep>

<br>

<p>The value inside the brackets which selects one element of the list is called an <strong>index</strong>, while the operation of selecting an element from the list is known as <strong>indexing</strong>.</p>

<p>We're going to use the <codel>print()</codel> function to print the list content each time we make the changes. This will help us follow each step more carefully and see what's going on after a particular list modification.</p>

<p>Note: all the indices used so far are literals. Their values are fixed at runtime, but <strong>any expression can be the index</strong>, too. This opens up lots of possibilities.</p>
