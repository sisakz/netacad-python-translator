<h1>Lists in lists: two-dimensional arrays ‒ continued</h1>

<p>Access to the selected field of the board requires two indices ‒ the first selects the row; the second ‒ the field number inside the row, which is de facto a column number.</p>

<p>Take a look at the chessboard. Every field contains a pair of indices which should be given to access the field's contents:</p>

<p>Glancing at the figure shown above, let's set some chess pieces on the board. First, let's add all the rooks:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">board[0][0] = ROOK
board[0][7] = ROOK
board[7][0] = ROOK
board[7][7] = ROOK
</codep>

<br>

<p>If you want to add a knight to C4, you do it as follows:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">board[4][2] = KNIGHT
</codep>

<br>

<p>And now a pawn to E5:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">board[3][4] = PAWN
</codep>

<br>

<p>And now ‒ experiment with the code in the editor.</p>
