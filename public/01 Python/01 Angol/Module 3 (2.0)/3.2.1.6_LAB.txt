<h2>Estimated time</h2>
<p>5-15 minutes</p>

<h2>Level of difficulty</h2>
<p>Very easy</p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Familiarize the student with:</p>

<ul>
<li>using the <font face="courier new">for</font> loop;</li>
<li>reflecting real-life situations in computer code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>Do you know what Mississippi is? Well, it's the name of one of the states and rivers in the United States. The Mississippi River is about 2,340 miles long, which makes it the second longest river in the United States (the longest being the Missouri River). It's so long that a single drop of water needs 90 days to travel its entire length!</p>

<p>The word <i>Mississippi</i> is also used for a slightly different purpose: to <i>count mississippily</i>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the phrase, we're here to explain to you what it means: it's used to count seconds.</p>

<p>The idea behind it is that adding the word <i>Mississippi</i> to a number when counting seconds aloud makes them sound closer to clock-time, and therefore "one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi" will take approximately an actual three seconds of time! It's often used by children playing hide-and-seek to make sure the seeker does an honest count.</p>

<br>


<p>Your task is very simple here: write a program that uses a <codel>for</codel> loop to "count mississippily" to five. Having counted to five, the program should print to the screen the final message <codel>"Ready or not, here I come!"</codel></p>

<p>Use the skeleton we've provided in the editor.</p>

<p><span class="label" style="background-color:orange;"><strong>EXTRA INFO</strong></span></p>

<p>Note that the code in the editor contains two elements which may not be fully clear to you at this moment: the <codel>import time</codel> statement, and the <codel>sleep()</codel> method. We're going to talk about them soon.</p>

<p>For the time being, we'd just like you to know that we've imported the <codel>time</codel> module and used the <codel>sleep()</codel> method to suspend the execution of each subsequent <codel>print()</codel> function inside the <codel>for</codel> loop for one second, so that the message outputted to the console resembles an actual counting. Don't worry - you'll soon learn more about modules and methods.</p>


<h2>Expected output</h2>

<codep>1 Mississippi
2 Mississippi
3 Mississippi
4 Mississippi
5 Mississippi</codep>
