<h1>Starting your work with Python</h1>

<p>Now that you have Python 3 installed, it's time to check if it works and make the very first use of it.</p>

<p>This will be a very simple procedure, but it should be enough to convince you that the Python environment is complete and functional.</p>

<p>There are many ways of utilizing Python, especially if you're going to be a Python developer.</p>

<p>To start your work, you need the following tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>an <strong>editor</strong> which will support you in writing the code (it should have some special features, not available in simple tools); this dedicated editor will give you more than the standard OS equipment;</li>
<li>a <strong>console</strong> in which you can launch your newly written code and stop it forcibly when it gets out of control;</li>
<li>a tool named a <strong>debugger</strong>, able to launch your code step-by-step, which will allow you to inspect it at each moment of execution.</li>
</ul>


<p>Besides its many useful components, the Python 3 standard installation contains a very simple but extremely useful application named IDLE.</p>

<p><strong>IDLE</strong> is an acronym: Integrated Development and Learning Environment.</p>
