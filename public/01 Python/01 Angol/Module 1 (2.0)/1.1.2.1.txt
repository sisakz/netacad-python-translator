<h1>What is Python?</h1>

<p>Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming.</p>

<p>And while you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called <strong>Monty Python's Flying Circus</strong>.</p>

<p>At the height of its success, the Monty Python team were performing their sketches to live audiences across the world, including at the Hollywood Bowl.</p>

<p>Since Monty Python is considered one of the two fundamental nutrients to a programmer (the other being pizza), Python's creator named the language in honor of the TV show.</p>

<h1>Who created Python?</h1>

<p>One of the amazing features of Python is the fact that it is actually one person's work. Usually, new programming languages are developed and published by large companies employing lots of professionals, and due to copyright rules, it is very hard to name any of the people involved in the project. Python is an exception.</p>

<p>There are not many languages whose authors are known by name. Python was created by <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" target="_blank">Guido van Rossum</a></strong>, born in 1956 in Haarlem, the Netherlands. Of course, Guido van Rossum did not develop and evolve all the Python components himself.</p>

<br><br>


<p>The speed with which Python has spread around the world is a result of the continuous work of thousands (very often anonymous) programmers, testers, users (many of them aren't IT specialists) and enthusiasts, but it must be said that the very first idea (the seed from which Python sprouted) came to one head - Guido's.</p>
