<h1>The <span style="font-family:courier new;">print()</span> function ‒ the escape and newline characters</h1>

<p>We've modified the code again. Look at it carefully.</p>

<p>There are two very subtle changes ‒ we've inserted a strange pair of characters inside the rhyme. They look like this: <codel>\n</codel>.</p>

<br>

<p>Interestingly, while <strong>you can see two characters, Python sees one.</strong></p>

<p>The backslash (<codel>\</codel>) has a very special meaning when used inside strings ‒ this is called <strong>the escape character</strong>.

<p>The word <i>escape</i> should be understood specifically ‒ it means that the series of characters in the string escapes for the moment (a very short moment) to introduce a special inclusion.</p>

<p>In other words, the backslash doesn't mean anything in itself, but is only a kind of announcement, that the next character after the backslash has a different meaning too.</p>

<p>The letter <codel>n</codel> placed after the backslash comes from the word <i>newline</i>.</p>

Both the backslash and the <i>n</i> form a special symbol named <strong>a newline character</strong>, which urges the console to start a <strong>new output line</strong>.</p>


<p>Run the code. Your console should now look like this:</p>

<codep>The itsy bitsy spider
climbed up the waterspout.

Down came the rain
and washed the spider out.</codep>

<p style="text-align: right;"><font size="-2"><b>output</b></font></p>

<p>As you can see, two newlines appear in the nursery rhyme, in the places where the <codel>\n</codel> have been used.</p>
