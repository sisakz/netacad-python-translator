<h1>The <span style="font-family:courier new;">print()</span> function â€’ using multiple arguments</h1>


<p>So far we have tested the <codel>print()</codel> function behavior with no arguments, and with one argument. It's also worth trying to feed the print() function with more than one argument.</p>

<p>Look at the editor window. This is what we're going to test now:</p>

<codep>print("The itsy bitsy spider" <mark style="background-color:#e6f2ff;">,</mark> "climbed up" <mark style="background-color:#e6f2ff;">,</mark> "the waterspout.")

</codep>
<br>
 

<p>There is one <codel>print()</codel> function invocation, but it contains <strong>three arguments</strong>. All of them are strings.</p>

<p>The arguments are <strong>separated by commas</strong>. We've surrounded them with spaces to make them more visible, but it's not really necessary, and we won't be doing it anymore.</p>

<p>In this case, the commas separating the arguments play a completely different role than the comma inside the string. The former is a part of Python's syntax, while the latter is intended to be shown in the console.</p>

<p>If you look at the code again, you'll see that there are no spaces inside the strings.</p>

<p>Run the code and see what happens.</p>


<p>The console should now be showing the following text:</p>

<codep>The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the waterspout.</codep>
<p style="text-align: right;"><font size="-2"><b>output</b></font></p>

<p>The spaces, removed from the strings, have appeared again. Can you explain why?</p>

<p>Two conclusions emerge from this example:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <codel>print()</codel> function invoked with more than one argument <strong>outputs them all on one line</strong>;</li>
<li>the <codel>print()</codel> function <strong>puts a space between the outputted arguments</strong> on its own initiative.</li>
</ul>
