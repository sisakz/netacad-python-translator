<p>Now it's time to talk about another type, which is designed to represent and to store the numbers that (as a mathematician would say) have a <strong>non-empty decimal fraction</strong>.</p>

<p>They are the numbers that have (or may have) a fractional part after the decimal point, and although such a definition is very poor, it's certainly sufficient for what we wish to discuss.</p>

<p>Whenever we use a term like <i>two and a half</i> or <i>minus zero point four</i>, we think of numbers which the computer considers <strong>floating-point</strong> numbers:</p>

<codep>2.5
-0.4</codep>

<br>

<p>Note: <i>two and a half</i> looks normal when you write it in a program, although if your native language prefers to use a comma instead of a point in the number, you should ensure that your <strong>number doesn't contain any commas</strong> at all.</p>

<p>Python will not accept that, or (in very rare but possible cases) may misunderstand your intentions, as the comma itself has its own reserved meaning in Python.</p>

<p>If you want to use just a value of two and a half, you should write it as shown above. Note once again: there is a point between <i>2</i> and <i>5</i>, not a comma.</p>

<p>As you can probably imagine, the value of <strong>zero point four</strong> could be written in Python as:</p>

<codep>0.4</codep>

<br>
 

<p>But don't forget this simple rule â€’ you can omit zero when it is the only digit in front of or after the decimal point.</p>

<p>In essence, you can write the value <codel>0.4</codel> as:</p>

<codep>.4</codep>

<br>

<p>For example: the value of <codel>4.0</codel> could be written as:</p>

<codep>4.</codep>

<br>

<p>This will change neither its type nor its value.</p>
