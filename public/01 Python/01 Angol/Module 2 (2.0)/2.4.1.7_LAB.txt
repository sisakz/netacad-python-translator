<h2>Estimated time</h2>
<p>10 minutes</p>

<h2>Level of difficulty</h2>
<p>Easy</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>becoming familiar with the concept of storing and working with different data types in Python;</li>
<li>experimenting with Python code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>Here is a short story:</p>
<p>Once upon a time in Appleland, John had three apples, Mary had five apples, and Adam had six apples. They were all very happy and lived for a long time. End of story.</p>
<p>Your task is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create the variables: <codel>john</codel>, <codel>mary</codel>, and <codel>adam</codel>;</li>
<li>assign values to the variables. The values must be equal to the numbers of fruit possessed by John, Mary, and Adam respectively;</li>
<li>having stored the numbers in the variables, print the variables on one line, and separate each of them with a comma;</li>
<li>now create a new variable named <codel>total_apples</codel> equal to the addition of the three previous variables.</li>
<li>print the value stored in <codel>total_apples</codel> to the console;</li>
<li><strong>experiment with your code</strong>: create new variables, assign different values to them, and perform various arithmetic operations on them (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, etc.). Try to print a string and an integer together on one line, e.g., <codel>"Total number of apples:"</codel> and <codel>total_apples</codel>.</li>
</ul>
