<h2>Estimated time</h2>
<p>5 minutes</p>

<h2>Level of difficulty</h2>
<p>Very Easy</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>becoming familiar with the concept of comments in Python;</li>
<li>using and not using comments;</li>
<li>replacing comments with code;</li>
<li>experimenting with Python code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>The code in the editor contains comments. Try to improve it: add or remove comments where you find it appropriate (yes, sometimes removing a comment can make the code more readable), and change variable names where you think this will improve code comprehension.</p>



<p><span class="label" style="background-color:orange;"><b>NOTE</b></span></p>

<p>Comments are very important. They are used not only to make your programs <strong>easier to understand</strong>, but also to <strong>disable those pieces of code that are currently not needed</strong> (e.g., when you need to test some parts of your code only, and ignore others). Good programmers <strong>describe</strong> each important piece of code, and give <strong>self-commenting names</strong> to variables, as sometimes it is simply much better to leave information in the code.</p>

<p>It's good to use <strong>readable</strong> variable names, and sometimes it's better to <strong>divide your code</strong> into named pieces (e.g., functions). In some situations, it's a good idea to write the steps of computations in a clearer way.</p>
<p>One more thing: it may happen that a comment contains a wrong or incorrect piece of information â€’ you should never do that on purpose!</p>
