<h1>Arithmetic operators: integer division</h1>


<p>A <codel>//</codel> (double slash) sign is an <strong>integer division</strong> operator. It differs from the standard <codel>/</codel> operator in two details:</p>

<ul>
<li>its result lacks the fractional part ‒ it's absent (for integers), or is always equal to zero (for floats); this means that <strong>the results are always rounded</strong>;</li>
<li>it conforms to the <i>integer vs. float rule</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Run the example below and see the results:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">print(6 // 3)
print(6 // 3.)
print(6. // 3)
print(6. // 3.)
</codep>


<br>

<p>As you can see, <i>integer by integer division</i> gives an <strong>integer result</strong>. All other cases produce floats.</p>

<br>

<p>Let's do some more advanced tests.</p>

<p>Look at the following snippet:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">print(6 // 4)
print(6. // 4)
</codep>


<br>

<p>Imagine that we used <codel>/</codel> instead of <codel>//</codel> ‒ could you predict the results?</p>

<p>Yes, it would be <codel>1.5</codel> in both cases. That's clear.</p>

<p>But what results should we expect with <codel>//</codel> division?</p>

<p>Run the code and see for yourself.</p>

<br>

<p>What we get is two ones ‒ one integer and one float.</p>

<p>The result of integer division is always rounded to the nearest integer value that is less than the real (not rounded) result.</p>

<p>This is very important: <strong>rounding always goes to the lesser integer</strong>.</p>


<br>

<p>Look at the code below and try to predict the results once again:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">print(-6 // 4)
print(6. // -4)
</codep>

<br>

<p>Note: some of the values are negative. This will obviously affect the result. But how?</p>

<p>The result is two negative twos. The real (not rounded) result is <codel>-1.5</codel> in both cases. However, the results are the subjects of rounding. The <strong>rounding goes toward the lesser integer value</strong>, and the lesser integer value is <codel>-2</codel>, hence: <codel>-2</codel> and <codel>-2.0</codel>.</p>


<p><span class="label" style="background-color:orange;"><b>NOTE</b></span></p>
<p>Integer division can also be called <strong>floor division</strong>. You will definitely come across this term in the future.</p>
