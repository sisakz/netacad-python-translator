<code>
print("Hello, World!")

<h1>Hello, World!</h1>

<p>It's time to start writing some <strong>real, working Python code</strong>. It'll be very simple for the time being.</p>

<p>As we're going to show you some fundamental concepts and terms, these snippets of code won't be all that serious or complex.</p>

<p>Run the code in the editor window on the right. If everything goes okay here, you'll see the <strong>line of text</strong> in the console window.</p>

<p>Alternatively, launch IDLE, create a new Python source file, fill it with this code, name the file and save it. Now run it. If everything goes okay, you'll see the text contained within the quotation marks in the IDLE console window. The code you have run should look familiar. You saw something very similar when we led you through the setting up of the IDLE environment.</p>

<p>Now we'll spend some time showing and explaining to you what you're actually seeing, and why it looks like this.</p>

<p>As you can see, this first program consists of the following parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>the word <codel>print</codel>;</li>
<li>an opening parenthesis;</li>
<li>a quotation mark;</li>
<li>a line of text: <codel>Hello, World!</codel>;</li>
<li>another quotation mark;</li>
<li>a closing parenthesis.</li>
</ul>
 

<p>Each of the above plays a very important role in the code.</p>
