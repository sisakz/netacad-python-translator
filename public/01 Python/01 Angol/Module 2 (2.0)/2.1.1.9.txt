print()
print("Down came the rain and washed the spider out.")

<h1>The <span style="font-family:courier new;">print()</span> function ‒ instructions</h1>


<p>We've changed the example a bit ‒ we've added one <strong>empty</strong> <codel>print()</codel> function invocation. We call it empty because we haven't delivered any arguments to the function.</p>

<p>You can see it in the editor window. Run the code.</p>

<p>What happens?</p>


<p>If everything goes right, you should see something like this:</p>


<codep>The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the waterspout.

Down came the rain and washed the spider out.</codep>
<p style="text-align: right;"><font size="-2"><b>output</b></font></p>

<p>As you can see, the empty <codel>print()</codel> invocation is not as empty as you may have expected ‒ it does output an empty line, or (this interpretation is also correct) it outputs a newline.</p>

<p>This is not the only way to produce a <strong>newline</strong> in the output console. We're now going to show you another way.</p>
