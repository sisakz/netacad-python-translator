<h1>Key takeaways</h1>


<p>1. The <codel>print()</codel> function is a <strong>built-in</strong> function. It prints/outputs a specified message to the screen/consol window.</p>

<p>2. Built-in functions, contrary to user-defined functions, are always available and don't have to be imported. Python 3.8 comes with 69 built-in functions. You can find their full list provided in alphabetical order in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" target="_blank">Python Standard Library</a>.</p>

<p>3. To call a function (this process is known as <strong>function invocation</strong> or <strong>function call</strong>), you need to use the function name followed by parentheses. You can pass arguments into a function by placing them inside the parentheses. You must separate arguments with a comma, e.g., <codel>print("Hello,", "world!")</codel>. An "empty" <codel>print()</codel> function outputs an empty line to the screen.</p>

<p>4. Python strings are delimited with <strong>quotes</strong>, e.g., <codel>"I am a string"</codel> (double quotes), or <codel>'I am a string, too'</codel> (single quotes).</p>

<p>5. Computer programs are collections of <strong>instructions</strong>. An instruction is a command to perform a specific task when executed, e.g., to print a certain message to the screen.</p>

<p>6. In Python strings the <strong>backslash</strong> (<codel>\</codel>) is a special character which announces that the next character has a different meaning, e.g., <codel>\n</codep> (the <strong>newline character</strong>) starts a new output line.</p>

<p>7. <strong>Positional arguments</strong> are the ones whose meaning is dictated by their position, e.g., the second argument is outputted after the first, the third is outputted after the second, etc.</p>

<p>8. <strong>Keyword arguments</strong> are the ones whose meaning is not dictated by their location, but by a special word (keyword) used to identify them.</p>

<p>9. The <codel>end</codel> and <codel>sep</codel> parameters can be used for formatting the output of the <codel>print()</codel> function. The <codel>sep</codel> parameter specifies the separator between the outputted arguments, e.g., <codel>print("H", "E", "L", "L", "O", sep="-")</codel>, whereas the <codel>end</codel> parameter specifies what to print at the end of the print statement.</p>
