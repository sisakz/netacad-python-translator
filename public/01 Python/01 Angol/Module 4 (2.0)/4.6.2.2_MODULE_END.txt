<h1>Congratulations! You have completed Module 4.</h1>

<br>


<p>Well done! You've reached the end of Module 4 and completed a major milestone in your Python programming education. Here's a short summary of the objectives you've covered and become familiar with in Module 4:</p>

<ul>
<li>the defining and using of functions âˆ’ their rationale, purpose, conventions, and traps;</li>

<li>the concept of passing arguments in different ways and setting their default values, along with the mechanisms of returning the function's results;</li>

<li>name scope issues;</li>

<li>new data aggregates: tuples and dictionaries, and their role in data processing.</li>

</ul>

<br>

<p>You are now ready to take the module quiz and attempt the final challenge: Module 4 Test, which will help you gauge what you've learned so far.</p>
