<h1>Strings</h1>


<p>Strings are used when you need to process text (like names of all kinds, addresses, novels, etc.), not numbers.</p>

<p>You already know a bit about them, e.g., that <strong>strings need quotes</strong> the way floats need points.</p>

<p>This is a very typical string: <codel>"I am a string."</codel></p>

<br>


<p>However, there is a catch. The catch is how to encode a quote inside a string which is already delimited by quotes.</p>

<p>Let's assume that we want to print a very simple message saying:</p>

<codep>I like "Monty Python"</codep>

<br>

<p>How do we do it without generating an error? There are two possible solutions.</p>




<br>

</div>


<div class="small-12 large-6 columns">

<p>The first is based on the concept we already know of the <strong>escape character</strong>, which you should remember is played by the <strong>backslash</strong>. The backslash can escape quotes too. A quote preceded by a backslash changes its meaning ‒ it's not a delimiter, but just a quote. This will work as intended:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">print("I like \"Monty Python\"")
</codep>

<br>

<p>Note: there are two escaped quotes inside the string ‒ can you see them both?</p>


<p>The second solution may be a bit surprising. Python can use <strong>an apostrophe instead of a quote</strong>. Either of these characters may delimit strings, but you must be <strong>consistent</strong>.</p>

<p>If you open a string with a quote, you have to close it with a quote.</p>

<p>If you start a string with an apostrophe, you have to end it with an apostrophe.</p>

<p>This example will work too:</p>


<codep class="syntax-color">print('I like "Monty Python"')
</codep>
 
<br>

<p>Note: you don't need to do any escaping here.</p>
