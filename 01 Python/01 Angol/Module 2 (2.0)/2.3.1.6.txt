<h1>Operators: addition</h1>

<p>The <strong>addition</strong> operator is the <codel>+</codel> (plus) sign, which is fully in line with mathematical standards.</p>

<p>Again, take a look at the snippet of the program below:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">print(-4 + 4)
print(-4. + 8)
</codep>

<br>

<p>The result should be nothing surprising. Run the code to check it.</p>

<br>

<h1>The subtraction operator, unary, and binary operators</h1>


<p>The <strong>subtraction</strong> operator is obviously the <codel>-</codel> (minus) sign, although you should note that this operator also has another meaning ‒ <strong>it can change the sign of a number</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a great opportunity to present a very important distinction between <strong>unary</strong> and <strong>binary</strong> operators.</p>


<p>In subtracting applications, the <strong>minus operator expects two arguments</strong>: the left (a <strong>minuend</strong> in arithmetical terms) and right (a <strong>subtrahend</strong>).</p>

<p>For this reason, the subtraction operator is considered to be one of the binary operators, just like the addition, multiplication and division operators.</p>

<p>But the minus operator may be used in a different (unary) way ‒ take a look at the last line of the snippet below:</p>

<codep>print(-4 - 4)
print(4. - 8)
<mark style="background-color:#e6f2ff;">print(-1.1)</mark>

</codep>

<br>

<p>By the way: there is also a unary <codel>+</codel> operator. You can use it like this:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">print(+2)
</codep>
<br>


<p>The operator preserves the sign of its only argument ‒ the right one.</p>

<p>Although such a construction is syntactically correct, using it doesn't make much sense, and it would be hard to find a good rationale for doing so.</p>

<p>Take a look at the snippet above ‒ can you guess its output?</p>
