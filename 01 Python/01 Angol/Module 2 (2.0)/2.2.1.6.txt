<h1>Ints vs. floats</h1>


<p>The decimal point is essential for recognizing floating-point numbers in Python.</p>

<p>Look at these two numbers:</p>

<codep>4
4.0</codep>

<br>

<p>You may think that they are exactly the same, but Python sees them in a completely different way.</p>

<p><codel>4</codel> is an <strong>integer</strong> number, whereas <codel>4.0</codel> is a <strong>floating-point</strong> number.</p>
 
<p>The point is what makes a float.</p>

<br>

<p>On the other hand, it's not only points that make a float. You can also use the letter <codel>e</codel>.</p>

<p>When you want to use any numbers that are very large or very small, you can use <strong>scientific notation</strong>.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the speed of light, expressed in <i>meters per second</i>. Written directly it would look like this: <codel>300000000</codel>.</p>

<p>To avoid writing out so many zeros, physics textbooks use an abbreviated form, which you have probably already seen: <codel>3 x 10<sup>8</sup></codel>.</p>

<p>It reads: three times ten to the power of eight.</p>

<p>In Python, the same effect is achieved in a slightly different way ‒ take a look:</p>

<codep>3E8</codep>

<br>
 
<p>The letter <codel>E</codel> (you can also use the lower-case letter <codel>e</codel> ‒ it comes from the word <strong>exponent</strong>) is a concise record of the phrase <i>times ten to the power of</i>.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <strong>exponent</strong> (the value after the <i>E</i>) has to be an integer;</li>
<li>the <strong>base</strong> (the value in front of the <i>E</i>) may be either an integer or a float.</li>
</ul>
