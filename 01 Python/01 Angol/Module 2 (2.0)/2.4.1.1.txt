<h1>What are variables?</h1>


<p>It seems fairly obvious that Python should allow you to encode literals carrying number and text values.</p>

<p>You already know that you can do some arithmetic operations with these numbers: add, subtract, etc. You'll be doing that many times.</p>

<p>But it's quite a normal question to ask how to <strong>store the results</strong> of these operations, in order to use them in other operations, and so on.</p>

<p>How do you save the intermediate results, and use them again to produce subsequent ones?</p>

<p>Python will help you with that. It offers special "boxes" (containers) for that purpose, and these boxes are called <strong>variables</strong> ‒ the name itself suggests that the content of these containers can be varied in (almost) any way.</p>

<p>What does every Python variable have?</p>

<ul>
<li>a name;</li>
<li>a value (the content of the container)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's start with the issues related to a variable's name.</p>

<p>Variables do not appear in a program automatically. As a developer, you must decide how many and which variables to use in your programs.</p>

<p>You must also name them.</p>

<div class="small-12 large-6 columns">




<p>If you want to <strong>give a name to a variable</strong>, you must follow some strict rules:</p>

<ul>

<li>the name of the variable must be composed of upper-case or lower-case letters, digits, and the character <codel>_</codel> (underscore)</li>
<li>the name of the variable must begin with a letter;</li>
<li>the underscore character is a letter;</li>
<li>upper- and lower-case letters are treated as different (a little differently than in the real world ‒ <i>Alice</i> and <i>ALICE</i> are the same first names, but in Python they are two different variable names, and consequently, two different variables);</li>
<li>the name of the variable must not be any of Python's reserved words (the keywords ‒ we'll explain more about this soon).</li>

</ul>
