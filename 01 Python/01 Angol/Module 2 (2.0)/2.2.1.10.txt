<h1>Boolean values</h1>

<p>To conclude with Python's literals, there are two additional ones.</p>

<p>They're not as obvious as any of the previous ones, as they're used to represent a very abstract value ‒ <strong>truthfulness</strong>.</p>

<p>Each time you ask Python if one number is greater than another, the question results in the creation of some specific data ‒ a <strong>Boolean</strong> value.</p>

<p>The name comes from George Boole (1815-1864), the author of the fundamental work, <i>The Laws of Thought</i>, which contains the definition of <strong>Boolean algebra</strong> ‒ a part of algebra which makes use of only two distinct values: <codel>True</codel> and <codel>False</codel>, denoted as <codel>1</codel> and <codel>0</codel>.</p>

<br>

<p>A programmer writes a program, and the program asks questions. Python executes the program, and provides the answers. The program must be able to react according to the received answers.</p>

<p>Fortunately, computers know only two kinds of answers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, this is true;</li>
<li>No, this is false.</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll never get a response like: <i>I don't know</i> or <i>Probably yes, but I don't know for sure</i>.</p>

<p>Python, then, is a <strong>binary</strong> reptile.</p>

<p>These two Boolean values have strict denotations in Python: </p>

<codep>True
False</codep>

<br>

<p>You cannot change anything ‒ you have to take these symbols as they are, including <strong>case-sensitivity</strong>.</p>

<br>

<p>Challenge: What will be the output of the following snippet of code?</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">print(True > False)
print(True < False)
</codep>

<br>

<p>Run the code in the Sandbox to check. Can you explain the result?</p>
