<h1>Type casting</h1>



<p>Python offers two simple functions to specify a type of data and solve this problem ‒ here they are: <codel>int()</codel> and <codel>float()</codel>.</p>

<p>Their names are self-commenting:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <codel>int()</codel> function <strong>takes one argument</strong> (e.g., a string: <codel>int(string)</codel>) and tries to convert it into an integer; if it fails, the whole program will fail too (there is a workaround for this situation, but we'll show you this a little later);</li>
<li>the <codel>float()</codel> function takes one argument (e.g., a string: <codel>float(string)</codel>) and tries to convert it into a float (the rest is the same).</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>This is very simple and very effective. Moreover, you can invoke any of the functions by passing the <codel>input()</codel> results directly to them. There's no need to use any variable as an intermediate storage.</p>

<p>We've implemented the idea in the editor ‒ take a look at the code.</p>


<p>Can you imagine how the string entered by the user flows from <codel>input()</codel> into <codel>print()</codel>?</p>

<p>Try to run the modified code. Don't forget to enter a <strong>valid number</strong>.</p>

<p>Check some different values, small and big, negative and positive. Zero is a good input, too.</p>
