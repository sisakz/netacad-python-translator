<h1>The <span style="font-family:courier new;">print()</span> function</h1>

<p>The only argument delivered to the <codel>print()</codel> function in this example is a <strong>string</strong>:</p>

<codep>print(<mark style="background-color:#e6f2ff;">"Hello, World!"</mark>)

</codep>
<br>

<p>As you can see, the <strong>string is delimited with quotes</strong> ‒ in fact, the quotes make the string ‒ they cut out a part of the code and assign a different meaning to it.</p>

<p>You can imagine that the quotes say something like: the text between us is not code. It isn't intended to be executed, and you should take it as is.</p>

<p>Almost anything you put inside the quotes will be taken literally, not as code, but as <strong>data</strong>. Try to play with this particular string ‒ modify it, enter some new content, delete some of the existing content.</p>

<p>There's more than one way to specify a string inside Python's code, but for now, though, this one is enough.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>So far, you have learned about two important parts of the code: the function and the string. We've talked about them in terms of syntax, but now it's time to discuss them in terms of semantics.</p>
