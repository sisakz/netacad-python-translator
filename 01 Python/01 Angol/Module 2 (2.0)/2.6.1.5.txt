<h1>More about <span style="font-family:courier new;">input()</span> and type casting</h1>


<p>Having a team consisting of the trio <codel>input()</codel>-<codel>int()</codel>-<codel>float()</codel> opens up lots of new possibilities.</p>

<p>You'll eventually be able to write complete programs, accepting data in the form of numbers, processing them and displaying the results.</p>

<p>Of course, these programs will be very primitive and not very usable, as they cannot make decisions, and consequently are not able to react differently to different situations.</p>

<p>This is not really a problem, though; we'll show you how to overcome it soon.</p>

<hr>

<p>Our next example refers to the earlier program to find the length of a hypotenuse. Let's rewrite it and make it able to read the lengths of the legs from the console.</p>

<p>Check out the editor window ‒ this is what it looks like now.</p>


<p>The program asks the user for the lengths of both legs, evaluates the hypotenuse and prints the result.</p>

<p>Run it and try to input some negative values.</p>

<p>The program, unfortunately, doesn't react to this obvious error.</p>

<p>Let's ignore this weakness for now. We'll come back to it soon.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that in the program that you can see in the editor, the <codel>hypo</codel> variable is used for only one purpose ‒ to save the calculated value between the execution of the adjoining line of code.</p>

<p>As the <codel>print()</codel> function accepts an expression as its argument, you can <strong>remove the variable</strong> from the code.</p>

<p>Just like this:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">leg_a = float(input("Input first leg length: "))
leg_b = float(input("Input second leg length: "))
print("Hypotenuse length is", (leg_a**2 + leg_b**2) ** .5)
</codep>
