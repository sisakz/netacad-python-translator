<h1>The <span style="font-family:courier new;">print()</span> function</h1>


<p>Three important questions have to be answered as soon as possible:</p>

<p><strong>1. What effect does the <codel>print()</codel> function cause?</strong></p>

<p>The effect is very useful and very spectacular. The function:</p>

<ul>
<li>takes its arguments (it may accept more than one argument and may also accept less than one argument)</li>
<li>converts them into human-readable form if needed (as you may suspect, strings don't require this action, as the string is already readable)</li>
<li>and <strong>sends the resulting data to the output device</strong> (usually the console); in other words, anything you put into the <codel>print()</codel> function will appear on your screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>No wonder then, that from now on, you'll utilize <codel>print()</codel> very intensively to see the results of your operations and evaluations.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>2. What arguments does <codel>print()</codel> expect?</strong></p>

<p>Any. We'll show you soon that <codel>print()</codel> is able to operate with virtually all types of data offered by Python. Strings, numbers, characters, logical values, objects â€’ any of these may be successfully passed to <codel>print()</codel>.</p>

<br>
 
<p><strong>3. What value does the <codel>print()</codel> function return?</strong></p>

<p>None. Its effect is enough.</p>
