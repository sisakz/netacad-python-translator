<h1>Three-dimensional arrays</h1>

<p>Python does not limit the depth of list-in-list inclusion. Here you can see an example of a three-dimensional array:</p>


<p>Imagine a hotel. It's a huge hotel consisting of three buildings, 15 floors each. There are 20 rooms on each floor. For this, you need an array which can collect and process information on the occupied/free rooms.</p>

<p>First step ‒ the type of the array's elements. In this case, a Boolean value (<codel>True</codel>/<codel>False</codel>) would fit.</p>

<p>Step two ‒ calm analysis of the situation. Summarize the available information: three buildings, 15 floors, 20 rooms.</p>


<p>Now you can create the array:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">rooms = [[[False for r in range(20)] for f in range(15)] for t in range(3)]
</codep>

<br>


<p>The first index (<codel>0</codel> through <codel>2</codel>) selects one of the buildings; the second (<codel>0</codel> through <codel>14</codel>) selects the floor, the third (<codel>0</codel> through <codel>19</codel>) selects the room number. All rooms are initially free.</p>

<p>Now you can book a room for two newlyweds: in the second building, on the tenth floor, room 14:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">rooms[1][9][13] = True
</codep>
<br>

<p>and release the second room on the fifth floor located in the first building:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">rooms[0][4][1] = False
</codep>
<br>

<p>Check if there are any vacancies on the 15th floor of the third building:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">vacancy = 0

for room_number in range(20):
    if not rooms[2][14][room_number]:
        vacancy += 1
</codep>

<br>

<p>The <codel>vacancy</codel> variable contains <codel>0</codel> if all the rooms are occupied, or the number of available rooms otherwise.</p>

<br>

<p>Congratulations! You've made it to the end of the module. Keep up the good work!</p>
