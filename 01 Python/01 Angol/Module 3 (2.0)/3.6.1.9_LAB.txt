<h2>Estimated time</h2>
<p>10-15 minutes</p>

<h2>Level of difficulty</h2>
<p>Easy</p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Familiarize the student with:</p>

<ul>
<li>list indexing;</li>
<li>utilizing the <codel>in</codel> and <codel>not in</codel> operators.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>Imagine a list ‒ not very long, not very complicated, just a simple list containing some integer numbers. Some of these numbers may be repeated, and this is the clue. We don't want any repetitions. We want them to be removed.</p>

<p>Your task is to write a program which removes all the number repetitions from the list. The goal is to have a list in which all the numbers appear not more than once.</p>

<p>Note: assume that the source list is hard-coded inside the code ‒ you don't have to enter it from the keyboard. Of course, you can improve the code and add a part that can carry out a conversation with the user and obtain all the data from her/him.</p>

<p>Hint: we encourage you to create a new list as a temporary work area ‒ you don't need to update the list in situ.</p>
<p>We've provided no test data, as that would be too easy. You can use our skeleton instead.</p>
