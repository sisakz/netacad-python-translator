<code>
numbers = [10, 5, 7, 2, 1]
print("Original list contents:", numbers)  # Printing original list contents.

numbers[0] = 111
print("\nPrevious list contents:", numbers)  # Printing previous list contents.

numbers[1] = numbers[4]  # Copying value of the fifth element to the second.
print("Previous list contents:", numbers)  # Printing previous list contents.

print("\nList length:", len(numbers))  # Printing the list's length.

</code>



<h1>Accessing list contents</h1>

<p>Each of the list's elements may be accessed separately. For example, it can be printed:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">print(numbers[0]) # Accessing the list's first element.
</codep>

<br>

<p>Assuming that all of the previous operations have been completed successfully, the snippet will send <codel>111</codel> to the console.</p>

<p>As you can see in the editor, the list may also be printed as a whole - just like here:</p>

<codep class="syntax-color">print(numbers)  # Printing the whole list.
</codep>

<br>

<p>As you've probably noticed before, Python decorates the output in a way that suggests that all the presented values form a list. The output from the example snippet above looks like this:</p>

<codep>[111, 1, 7, 2, 1]</codep>
<p style="text-align: right;"><font size="-2"><b>output</b></font></p>

<br>

<h2>The <font face="courier new">len()</font> function</h2>

<p>The <strong>length of a list</strong> may vary during execution. New elements may be added to the list, while others may be removed from it. This means that the list is a very dynamic entity.</p>

<p>If you want to check the list's current length, you can use a function named <codel>len()</codel> (its name comes from <i>length</i>).</p>

<p>The function takes the <strong>list's name as an argument, and returns the number of elements currently stored</strong> inside the list (in other words ‒ the list's length).</p>

<p>Look at the last line of code in the editor, run the program and check what value it will print to the console. Can you guess?</p>
