<h2>Estimated time</h2>
<p>20-30 minutes</p>

<h2>Level of difficulty</h2>
<p>Medium</p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Familiarize the student with:</p>
<ul>
<li>using the <codel>while</codel> loop;</li>
<li>finding the proper implementation of verbally defined rules;</li>
<li>reflecting real-life situations in computer code.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>Listen to this story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid.</p>

<p>Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall – it's flat. The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.<p>

<p>The figure illustrates the rule used by the builders:</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.</p>

<p>Note: the height is measured by the number of <strong>fully completed layers</strong> – if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.</p>

<p>Test your code using the data we've provided.</p>

<br>


<h2>Test Data</h2>

<br>

<p>Sample input: <codel>6</codel></p>
<p>Expected output: <codel>The height of the pyramid: 3</codel></p>

<hr>

<p>Sample input: <codel>20</codel></p>
<p>Expected output: <codel>The height of the pyramid: 5</codel></p>

<hr>

<p>Sample input: <codel>1000</codel></p>
<p>Expected output: <codel>The height of the pyramid: 44</codel></p>

<hr>

<p>Sample input: <codel>2</codel></p>
<p>Expected output: <codel>The height of the pyramid: 1</codel></p>
