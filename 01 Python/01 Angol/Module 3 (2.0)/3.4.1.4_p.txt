<h1>Removing elements from a list</h1>

<p>Any of the list's elements may be <strong>removed</strong> at any time ‒ this is done with an instruction named <codel>del</codel> (delete). Note: it's an <strong>instruction</strong>, not a function.</p>

<p>You have to point to the element to be removed ‒ it'll vanish from the list, and the list's length will be reduced by one.</p>

<p>Look at the snippet below. Can you guess what output it will produce? Run the program in the editor and check.</p>

<codep><mark style="background-color:#e6f2ff;">del numbers[1]</mark>
print(len(numbers))
print(numbers)

</codep> 

<br>

<hr>

<p><strong>You can't access an element which doesn't exist</strong> ‒ you can neither get its value nor assign it a value. Both of these instructions will cause runtime errors now:</p>

<codep style="color:red;">print(numbers[4])
numbers[4] = 1

</codep>

<br>

<p>Add the snippet above after the last line of code in the editor, run the program and check what happens.</p>

<p>Note: we've removed one of the list's elements ‒ there are only four elements in the list now. This means that element number four doesn't exist.</p>
