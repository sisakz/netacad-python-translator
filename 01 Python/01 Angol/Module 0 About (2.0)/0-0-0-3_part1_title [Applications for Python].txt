<h1>Where do you use Python?</h1>

<p>Do you remember Battlefield 2, Battlefield 2142 and Battlefield Heroes- strategy and first-person shooter games from EA DICE? All the games use Python for logic and server controls. Python is frequently used for creating open-source, free games, e.g., OpenRTS, PySol, Metin 2, or Frets On Fire - famous Guitar Hero-like games written in pygame.</p>

<p>And what about the major websites and services? Dropbox? UBER? Spotify? Pintrest? BuzzFeed? Yes. They were all written, to a greater or lesser extent, in Python. Other examples?</p>

<ul>
<li>Internet Applications (BitTorrent, Jogger Publishing Assistant, TheCircle, TwistedMatrix)</li>
<li>3D CAD/CAM (FreeCAD, Fandango, Blender, Vintech RCAM)</li>
<li>Enterprise Applications (Odoo, Tryton, Picalo, LinOTP 2, RESTx)</li>
<li>Image Applications (Gnofract 4D, Gogh, imgSeek, MayaVi, VPython)</li>
<li>Mobile Applications (Aarlogic C05/3, AppBackup, Pyroute)</li>
<li>Office Applications (calibre, faces, Notalon, pyspread)</li>
<li>Personal Information Managers (BitPim, Narval, Prioritise, Task Coach, WikidPad)

<p>Generally, Python is a great choice for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web and Internet development (e.g., Django and Pyramid frameworks, Flask and Bottle micro-frameworks)</li>
<li>Scientific and numeric computing (e.g., SciPy - a collection of packages for the purposes of mathematics, science, and engineering; Ipython - an interactive shell that features editing and recording of work sessions)</li>
<li>Education (it's a brilliant language for teaching programming. And that's why we're offering this course to you!)</li>
<li>Desktop GUIs (e.g., wxWidgets, Kivy, Qt)</li>
<li>Software Development (build control, management, and testing - Scons, Buildbot, Apache Gump, Roundup, Trac)</li>
<li>Business applications (ERP and e-commerce systems - Odoo, Tryton)

</ul>

<p>And many, many other projects and development tools.</p>
