<p>The main goal of the course is to guide you from a state of complete programming illiteracy to a level of programming knowledge which allows you to <b>design</b>, <b>write</b>, <b>debug</b>, and <b>run</b> programs encoded in the Python language, and to understand the <b>basic concepts of software development technology</b>.</p>

<p>The course will prepare you for jobs and careers connected with widely understood <b>software development</b>, which includes not only creating the code itself as a junior developer, but also computer <b>systems design</b> and <b>software testing</b>.</p>
