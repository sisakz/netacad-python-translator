<h1>Entry-Level Certification: PCEP &ndash; Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer</h1>

<p><i>Python Essentials 1</i> (PE1) is aligned with the <i>PCEP &ndash; Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer</i> certification.</p>

<p><a href="https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep-certification-entry-level" target="_blank">PCEP &ndash; Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer</a> certification is a professional credential that measures the test-taker's ability to accomplish coding tasks related to <b>the essentials of programming in the Python language</b>.</p>

<p>A test candidate should demonstrate sufficient knowledge of <b>the universal concepts</b> of computer programming, <b>the syntax and semantics</b> of the Python language as well as the <b>skills in resolving typical implementation challenges</b> with the help of the Python Standard Library.</p>

<p><i>PCEP &ndash; Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer</i> certification shows that the individual is familiar with universal computer programming concepts like <b>basic operators, numeral systems, Boolean logic, data types, containers, functions, conditions, loops</b>, as well as Python programming language <b>syntax, semantics, and the runtime environment</b>.</p>

<p><i>PCEP &ndash; Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer</i> certification is <b>an interim step</b> to the <i>PCAP - Certified Associate in Python Programming</i> certification and <b>the starting point</b> to launch a career in software development, Python programming, and related technologies.</p>

<p>Becoming PCEP certified will help the certificate holder stand out from other candidates and get their foot in the door.</p>
