<td>
<ul>
<li>the execution of the translated code is usually faster;</li>
<li>only the user has to have the compiler - the end-user may use the code without it;</li>
<li>the translated code is stored using machine language - as it is very hard to understand it, your own inventions and programming tricks are likely to remain your secret.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>you can run the code as soon as you complete it - there are no additional phases of translation;</li>
<li>the code is stored using programming language, not machine language - this means that it can be run on computers using different machine languages; you don't compile your code separately for each different architecture.</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td><center><p><span class="alert label"><strong>DISADVANTAGES</strong></span></p></center></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>the compilation itself may be a very time-consuming process - you may not be able to run your code immediately after making an amendment;</li>
<li>you have to have as many compilers as hardware platforms you want your code to be run on.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>don't expect interpretation to ramp up your code to high speed - your code will share the computer's power with the interpreter, so it can't be really fast;</li>
<li>both you and the end user have to have the interpreter to run your code.</li>

<p><b>What does this all mean for you?</b>


<ul>
<li>Python is an <strong>interpreted language</strong>. This means that it inherits all the described advantages and disadvantages. Of course, it adds some of its unique features to both sets.</li>

<li>If you want to program in Python, you'll need the <strong>Python interpreter</strong>. You won't be able to run your code without it. Fortunately, <strong>Python is free</strong>. This is one of its most important advantages.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to historical reasons, languages designed to be utilized in the interpretation manner are often called <strong>scripting languages</strong>, while the source programs encoded using them are called <strong>scripts</strong>.</p>
