<h1>How to write and run your very first program</h1>

<p>It is now time to write and run your first Python 3 program. It will be very simple, for now.</p>

<p>The first step is to create a new source file and fill it with code. Click <i>File</i> in the IDLE menu and choose <i>New file</i>.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>As you can see, IDLE opens a new window for you. You can use it to write and amend your code.</p>

<p>This is the <strong>editor window</strong>. Its only purpose is to be a workplace in which your source code is treated. Do not confuse the editor window with the shell window. They perform different functions.</p>

<p>The editor window is currently untitled, but it's good practice to start work by naming the source file.</p>

<p>Click <i>File</i> (in the new window), then click <i>Save as...</i>, select a folder for the new file (the desktop is a good place for your first programming attempts) and chose a name for the new file.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Note: don't set any extension for the file name you are going to use. Python needs its files to have the <i>.py</i> extension, so you should rely on the dialog window's defaults. Using the standard </i>.py</i> extension enables the OS to properly open these files.</p>
