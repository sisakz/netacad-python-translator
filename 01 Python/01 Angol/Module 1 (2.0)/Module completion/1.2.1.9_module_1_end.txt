<ul>
<li>the fundamentals of computer programming, i.e., how the computer works, how the program is executed, how the programming language is defined and constructed;</li>

<li>the difference between compilation and interpretation;</li>

<li>the basic information about Python and how it is positioned among other programming languages, and what distinguishes its different versions;</li>
